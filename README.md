# Weather App

## Depends on
- NPM package: `postman-request`
- Valid access tokens for MapBox API (50,000 requests per month limit) as well as Weather Stack API (250 requests per month limit). Currently using `dotenv` package and storing it locally in a `.env` config file.

## Key lessons
- Exploring asynchronous Node.js
- Lots of practice with callback functions
- Making and customising HTTP requests
- Error handling
- Practice with callback chaining
- Do not commit secrets like access tokens to GitHub
- ES6 feature such as object property shorthand + destructuring
